The following workarounds have been put in place in order to get xbmc compiled more quickly:

-Python does not build fully
-DESTDIR and PREFIX need to be reworked
-rsxs and projectm screensavers disabled
-dbus disabled
-troublesome code commented in WinSystemEGL.cpp. This file will be reworked anyway.
-removed --disable-jpg-shared --disable-tif-shared --disable-png-shared from libsdl_image. These can be
  reinstated once path problems have been fixed.
-Blanked LIBS for several subprojects. Need to investigate if we can avoid this export.
-https disabled for libmicrohttpd
