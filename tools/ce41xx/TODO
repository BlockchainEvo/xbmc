The following workarounds have been put in place in order to get xbmc compiled more quickly:

- Python does not build fully
- rsxs and projectm screensavers disabled
- troublesome code commented in WinSystemEGL.cpp. This file will be reworked anyway.
- added rpath to TexturePacker so it can find and use SDL and friends, this will need to get refactored before trunk inclusion
