This folder holds all the platform dependend build scripts which are called from the jenkins buildserver.

The following ENV variables are available on all scripts:

$WORKSPACE - the folder where jenkins checked out the source - XBMC_HOME so to say
$Configuration - its either Debug, Release or Default and should be taken into account if possible (Defaults select platform default from <platformdir>/startbuild)
$SDK_VERSION - the requested SDK_VERSION to be used for building. If "Default" is passed it uses the platform default from <platformdir>/startbuild
$BUILDTHREADS - number of threads which can be used when building (e.x. use it for make -j$BUILDTHREADS)
$XBMC_DEPENDS_ROOT - root for installing the xbmc build depends and toolchain helpers. If "Default" is passed it uses the platform default from <platformdir>/startbuild
